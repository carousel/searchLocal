<h1>Local Search App</h1>

<p>This app will search through local data storage. In this case it is plain javascript array, but it can be modified for any kind of storage ( local or remote ). It is written with the help of jQuery, so it can soon became plugin. Also, I am using Coffescript, which is compiled to native JS.
